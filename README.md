# Marketplace

This "Marketplace" project was completed as a test task for Red Collar from frontend developer Sardana Dordzhieva.

<br></br>
On the website, you can browse products, view photos in the product card using a slider, search for products, select a category of interest, read the product description, and add a favorite product to the cart.
In the cart, you can delete a product, increase the quantity of a product added, or decrease the quantity, view the final price of the item, and the total amount of items in the cart.
<br></br>
The main stack is React.js, SCSS, Redux Toolkit, Vite.
Redux Toolkit was used in the development of product search, category filtering, shopping cart, and infinite scroll.
Lodash.debounce was also used in product search to avoid frequent API requests. Validation of the request - yup
React-swiper was used in the horizontal scroll of categories.
The product card image slider is made with react-slick.
Product loading at the start and during "infinite scroll" is done using the Ant Design component.
In "infinite scroll" - a custom hook.
